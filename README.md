# Emmanuel Lemos — Portfolio

Personal portfolio project developed to showcase my transition into frontend development, combining design experience with hands-on learning in modern web technologies.

This project focuses on clean structure, practical experimentation and progressive improvement rather than advanced abstractions.

--------------------------------------------------

## About the Project

This portfolio presents selected projects, skills and professional experience, highlighting my interest in frontend development, UI structure and interactive behavior.

It was built as a learning-focused project, where each feature was implemented with the intention of understanding how it works, not just making it work.

--------------------------------------------------

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Vite
- PostCSS (build-time CSS processing)

--------------------------------------------------

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Solid understanding of HTML semantics and layout structure
- Responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS
- Component-based CSS organization
- Basic JavaScript logic for UI behavior and interactions
- Theme switching (Dark / Light)
- Internationalization (EN / PT-BR) with fallback logic
- Configuration-driven content (config.demo.js)
- Custom UI animations and carousels without external UI libraries
- Attention to code readability and maintainability

Several features were intentionally implemented manually to reinforce learning and practical understanding.

## Running the Project Locally

Install dependencies:

npm install

Run the development server:

npm run dev

--------------------------------------------------

## Configuration Approach

This project separates content and configuration from the core codebase.

- config.demo.js — public demo configuration
- i18n.demo.js — language dictionaries
- .env.example — environment reference

This approach makes the project easier to understand, reuse and maintain.

--------------------------------------------------

## Project Status

This is an evolving project, continuously improved as part of my learning journey in frontend development.
